Task 
-----
Complete the code in the editor below. The variables i, d, and s are already declared and 
initialized for you. You must:
	1. Declare 3 variables: one of type int, one of type double, and one of type String.
	2. Read 3 lines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given in the Input Format 
	   section below) and initialize your 3 variables.
	3. Use the  operator to perform the following operations: 
		1. Print the sum of  plus your int variable on a new line.
		2. Print the sum of  plus your double variable to a scale of one decimal place on a 
		   new line.
		3. Concatenate  with the string you read as input and print the result on a new line.
Note: If you are using a language that doesn't support using  for string concatenation 
(e.g.: C), you can just print one variable immediately following the other on the same line. 
The string provided in your editor must be printed first, immediately followed by the string 
you read as input.

Sample Input
-------------
12
4.0
is the best place to learn and practice coding!

--------------
Sample Output
--------------
16
8.0
HackerRank is the best place to learn and practice coding!

------------
Explanation
------------
When we sum the integers 4 and 12, we get the integer 16. 
When we sum the floating-point numbers 4.0 and 4.0, we get 8.0. 
When we concatenate HackerRank with is the best place to learn and practice coding!, we get 
HackerRank is the best place to learn and practice coding!.
