Task 
-----
Given the meal price (base cost of a meal), tip percent (the percentage of the meal price 
being added as tip), and tax percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tax) 
for a meal, find and print the meal's total cost.

Note: Be sure to use precise values for your calculations, or you may end up with an 
incorrectly rounded result!

12.00

Sample Output
--------------
15

------------
Explanation
------------
Given: 
mealCost = 12, tipPercent = 20, taxPercent = 8
Calculations:
tip = 12*(20/100) = 2.4
tax = 12*(8/100) = 0.96
totalCost = mealCost + tip + tax = 12 + 2.4 + 0.96 = 15.36
round(totalCost) = 15

We round totalCost to the nearest dollar (integer) and then print our result, 15.
